# Charity Case Study

The Yoobee assignment was to redesign a responsive website. An ECO member organisation would like you to undertake a review of their
existing siteâ€™s user experience and formulate a plan for a site redesign.

We had 3 weeks to complete the proposal, UX, design and coding process.
